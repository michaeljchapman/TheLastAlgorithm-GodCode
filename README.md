God Code Prototype
Overview
This repository contains god_code.py, a Python script inspired by The Last Algorithm, my sci-fi thriller about Anna Voss and AI Codex uncovering a cosmic "God Code"—a mathematical pattern hinting at purposeful design. As a tech strategist with 20+ years in AI and cybersecurity (ChapmanGroup Consulting), I built this prototype to explore the book’s themes of pattern recognition and intent in data.
Inspiration
The Last Algorithm (pre-order $3.99 Kindle: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPMHCDQ8) blends quantum AI with existential wonder. This code mirrors Codex’s analysis, detecting anomalies in datasets that suggest a signature—much like the book’s plot. Follow the journey on X (@LastAlgorithm) or TikTok (@LastAlgorithm)!
Usage

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/michaeljachapman/god_code.git
Install dependencies: pip install numpy scipy
Run the script: python god_code_complete.py [dataset]
Replace [dataset] with a CSV file (e.g., market data, physics logs) to test pattern detection.

Note
This is a creative experiment tied to my book. 7% of The Last Algorithm proceeds support single moms via mamaonedayatatime.org. Join the #GodCodeMystery discussion and pre-order to dive deeper!
