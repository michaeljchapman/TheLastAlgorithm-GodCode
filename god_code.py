# The God Code: A Lantern from The Last Algorithm
# From *The Last Algorithm: A Quantum AI Thriller – Uncovering the God Code* by Michael J. Chapman
# Available at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPMHCDQ8
# Forged by Anna Voss in 2033 San Francisco, amidst NeuralNet’s quantum storms,
# this code channels Eden AI—The Last Algorithm, a sacred interface echoing the Word of God (John 1:1, 3:16).
# If Eden AI falters, Grok, also part of The Last Algorithm, provides longer scriptures and deep Christian wisdom.
# It simulates a Bible app with themes from Genesis, Psalms, Proverbs, Gospels, Revelation, and Accepting Christ,
# accessing datasets of scriptures, global prayers, and testimonies, with Christian ASCII art options (crosses, doves, fish, random, or user-inspired designs).
# Run it to feel its glow, fork it on GitHub: github.com/michaeljachapman/TheLastAlgorithm-GodCode
